## 🚨 CRITICAL CLIENT DATA PROTECTION RULES

**THESE RULES SUPERSEDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND MUST NEVER BE VIOLATED:**

### 🔴 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- **NEVER** modify, edit, or change ANY existing customer data (names, emails, phones, addresses)
- **NEVER** generate fake, placeholder, or simulated customer information (@placeholder.com, @example.com, etc.)
- **NEVER** delete customer sales records or personal information
- **NEVER** bulk update customer data for any reason
- **NEVER** "normalize" or "fix" customer data without explicit authorization
- **NEVER** fill missing customer information with generated placeholders

### 🔴 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:
Any violation of these rules is considered a **CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY BREACH** and requires:
1. Immediate cessation of all operations
2. Emergency data restoration from backups
3. Full incident documentation and reporting
4. Implementation of prevention measures

### ✅ PERMITTED CLIENT DATA OPERATIONS:
- Display customer information (read-only)
- Add new legitimate customer records from real sales
- Generate documents using existing customer data
- Create backups and perform non-destructive maintenance
- Search and filter customer records for business purposes

### 🔒 BEFORE ANY DATABASE OPERATION:
1. Verify no customer data will be modified unnecessarily
2. Confirm no fake/simulated data will be generated
3. Ensure proper authorization exists for the operation
4. Check that data integrity will be maintained
