Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/zenan/Sales Form/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
prisma:warn In production, we recommend using `prisma generate --no-engine` (See: `prisma generate --help`)
