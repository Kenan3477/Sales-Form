# Vercel Deployment Force

This file was created on 16 January 2026 at 12:50 to force trigger Vercel deployment.
**Updated on 17 January 2026 at 10:50 for customer deduplication deployment**

## Issue:
Vercel is not automatically picking up the latest commits despite successful pushes to main branch.

## Latest Changes to Deploy:
1. ✅ Comprehensive User Management System
2. ✅ Enhanced Security Infrastructure  
3. ✅ Customer Deduplication System
4. ✅ Real-time duplicate detection in sales forms
5. ✅ Import deduplication protection
6. ✅ Advanced security logging and rate limiting

## Deployment Status:
- **User Management**: Admin user creation, editing, deletion with security
- **Customer Deduplication**: Real-time checking, confidence-based warnings, import protection
- **Security**: Enterprise-level rate limiting, input validation, comprehensive logging
- **Features**: Appliance management (500-800 cover limits), 10 appliance maximum

## Force Deploy Trigger:
**Timestamp: 2026-01-17T10:50:00Z**
**Commit: e9995fe - Add customer deduplication documentation and tests**

## Solution Attempts:
1. Updated README with new version info
2. Updated deployment trigger documentation
3. Bumped version to 1.0.0 (major version)
4. Created this new file to ensure significant repository change
5. Will commit and push to force webhook trigger

## Expected Result:
Vercel should detect these changes and deploy the complete feature set including:
- Agent name functionality
- Hardcoded agent dropdown
- Mandatory city field
- Postcode lookup
- Export enhancements
